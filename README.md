# LuminiCore

**LuminiCore** is a collection of packages that provide essential best practices and architectural patterns for building modern applications quickly and efficiently.

The project is designed to serve as a solid foundation for scalable, maintainable, and clean application development — enabling teams to reuse proven patterns instead of reinventing them in every new project.

## 🎯 Project Goals

LuminiCore aims to:

- Standardize application architecture
- Accelerate new project setup
- Promote modern development patterns
- Encourage clean, modular, and maintainable code
- Reduce boilerplate in application layers

## 📦 Available Packages

### ✅ CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

The CQRS package provides foundational infrastructure for implementing the CQRS pattern, including:

- Clear separation of Commands and Queries
- Base abstractions for handlers
- Application-layer orchestration support
- Structured request/response handling

This package simplifies the implementation of a clean and scalable application layer.
